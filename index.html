        <h1 class="display-3">Js Lexical scope:</h1>
        <p class="disp-5">- Java script is a single threded language , which means is excutes in order , it is Synchronised for the most part but WEB APIS added some Asynchrinised parts to the language.
            - every thred has it's own memory and call stack.
            <span class="sub">call stack:</span> 
            it is a set of functions that gets excuted , it also manages the excution context  and they are LIFO , at the very bottom of evry call stack , there is the global excution context , then out function stacked at top , it is actually a data structure
            - how to represent call stack ? , basically it push the first function , excutes it then pop() it out , before pushing the next function.
            <span class="sub">Excution context:</span>
            it is an envirement to handle the transformation of the code and it conaines all the  currently excuting code and the varibles that are their to aid the excution
            gloal excution context,function excution context.
            - what are the EC phases?
            <span class="sub hidden">Creation phase</span>
            <span class="hidden">- creat the global object (window) in js.</span>
            <span class="hidden">- creat the 'this' object and binds it to the global object</span>
            <span class="hidden">- set up memory heap for storing vars and function reference</span>
            <span class="hidden">- stor vars and functions in the global excution context and set them to => undefined</span>
            <span class="sub hidden">excution phase</span>
            <span class="hidden">- excute every line of code</span>
            <span class="hidden">- creats a new EC for every function call</span>
            - how does the EC work here? in steps
        </p>

        - Allocat memory for x , sets it to undefined.
        - Allocat memory for y , sets it to undefined.
        - get the function getSum() allocates memory and stores all the code inside
        - sum1 , and sum2 , allocates memory for both and sets them to undefined.
        <span class="sub">excution:</span>
        - sets the value of x to 100
        - sets the value of y to 50
        - it skips the function def
        - line 7 , it invoces the getSum() function and starts a new EC for the function:
        - #{
            <span class="sub">inside the EC of the function:</span>
            <span class="sub">* creation phase:</span>

            - allocate memory for sum and set it to undefined.
            <span class="sub">* excution phase:</span>
            - n1 and n2 are assigned there values 
            - the calculation is done and the result is assigned to the sum variable
            - the return tells the function EC to return the value to the global EC 
            - the returned value is assigned to the sum1
        }
        <span class="sub">Hoisting:</span>
        - it means that the inrepreter moves function declarations and variables declarations up to the top if their scop
        - when you console log var a = 5; before declaration you get unddefined , why?
        <span class="hidden">because the var is being declared , set to undefined (during the creation phase)</span>
        - what is the diffrence between var and let/const?
        <span class="hidden">let/const are block scoped , so if i tried to log it before their declaration , i'll get a refrence error , this doesn't mean that they are not hoisted , they are but they have their own special scop called "script" kind of a dead zone before it gets its values</span>
        <span class="sub">What is the lexical envirment of somthing?</span>
        <span class="hidden">it is a combination of the local memory of a function (idk) and it's lexical father (container) , tougther they make the lexical envirment</span>
        - What is shadowing? <span class="hidden">when an identifier with the same name gets used instead of the outher one because of scoping rules</span>
        - window.a
        This technique gives access to a global variable that would otherwise be inaccessible
        due to it being shadowed. However, non-global shadowed variables cannot be accessed
        - it does not matter where/how a function was invoked , its lexical scope depends on where it was declared

            - how many scope types are out there? 
            * there is function scopes , each function creats a scope for itself.
            * a function is considered to be an identefier that belogns to its outer scope.
            * You can basically hide variales buy contianing them in a functions
            * The principle of least privelige in softwar desogn means exposing the minimal necceceary values , and hide evrything else.

    <p class="disp-5">
        - in this case , the function doSomethingElse() is likely "private" details of how the doSomething does its job
        - a more proper design thi , is putting the doSomethingElse() declaration inside the doSomething declaraton, so they are not accesible for any outside influence or use.

        <p class="disp-5">
            - Why does this make an infinit loop? the value of i is being reset to 3 everytime the bar() excutes , meaning it will never get to 10
            - libaries often avoid var name collition by delevring one object that has a very unique name and you then acces the whole libary throught it.
            <span class="sub">Module:</span>
            - WHat are dependency managers?
            * apparantly they rae devided to 4 things:
            - package managers (npm , yarn)
            - Task runner (Gulp) althought , they are not dependancies
            - Module loaders (Browsify)
            - Static module bundler (webpack)
            *how is this relateed to front-end only?*
            - Anyways the dependencies could be : a module is just a js file with code in it. (also a piece of the app with some specific job)
            JS has to main module systems are CJS ESM , these are ways to import/export JS modules , best one is ESM , more <a href="http://dev.to/iggredible/what-the-heck-are-cjs-amd-umd-and-esm-ikm">here</a>
            - a libary is a set of modules that tougther provide some feuture
            - a pakage is a downlodable version of the libary , also contain some files that are non related to the functions itself but to ensure it works properly togther (like babel for react).
            *should add here discord answers as well*
            - how to avoid collision  ?
            <span class="hidden"> dependencies mangers make sure that each module has it's own scope.</span>
            - how tell between a function declaration and a function expression?
            <span class="hidden">if the function keyword was the first word to be typed it will be a declaration</span>
            - using IIFI actually hides the function name from the global scope.
            -function expressiong can have no name in oppose of the declarations.
            - what are the drawbacks of using anonymous functions?
            * <span class="hidden">they have no name to display in the call stack making debugging hard</span>

            <p class="disp-5"><span class="sub">explicit block scoping:</span>
                - to creat an explicit block scope you need to wrap your code inside { .. }
                - if you made some operations in the global scope , and even after they are done its possible that they are still in the memory because they still in the scope of clauser for the functions , to solve this we block scope them using { .. }
